				<h2>About the Venue - George Dilboy VFW Post 529</h2>
				<h3 id="bathrooms-vfw">Bathrooms</h3>
				<p>There are two multi-stall bathrooms in the building, down the hall to the right after you pass the ticket table. We invite you to use whichever bathroom you feel comfortable in. The bathroom on the right contains one (1) accessible sink, one (1) accessible stall, and one (1) urinal. The bathroom at the end of the hall contains two (2) standard sinks, two (2) standard stalls, and one (1) accessible stall. Both bathroom doors are slightly heavy.</p>
				<h3 id="seating-vfw">Seating</h3>
				<p>The seats in the VFW are armless, padded metal chairs. They will be arranged in two columns with a center aisle and aisles on either side with reserved wheelchair spaces in the front row. Chairs can easily be moved if more wheelchair spaces are needed.</p>
				<h3 id="navigation-vfw">Moving Around the Space</h3>
				<p>The VFW is fully wheelchair accessible. The entrance, performance space, and bathrooms are all on one level with no stairs. When you enter the building the table to purchase or pick up tickets will be directly in front of you and you will proceed past the table into the performance space where the stage will be on your right.</p>
				<h3 id="temperature-vfw">Temperature</h3>
				<p>The VFW is fully air conditioned.</p>

				<h2>About the Venue - Guild Church</h2>
				<h3 id="navigation-church">Moving Around the Space</h3>
				<p>Unfortunately the church is
					<strong>not wheelchair accessible</strong>
					and the entrance is up X stairs with
					<strong>no ramp</strong>. Once inside, the floor is hard wood with some irregularities due to age. Upon entering you will see the ticket table to your left and the merchandise and concessions table to your right. Proceed straight to enter the main sanctuary where the performance will take place. The floor in the sanctuary has a slight tilt away from the entrance.</p>
				<h3 id="bathrooms-church">Bathrooms</h3>
				<p>There are two multi-stall bathrooms in the church, both on the
					<strong>lower level</strong>
					of the building. When you enter through the front doors, turn left and go down all the way down the stairs then take the door to your right to reach a bathoom containing two stalls and one sink. Alternatively, go right from the front doors and all the way down the stairs then take the door on your left to reach a bathroom containing one stall, one urinal, and one sink. We invite visitors to use whichever bathroom you feel comfortable.</p>
				<h3 id="seating-church">Seating</h3>
				<p>The seating in the church is two rows of traditional wooden pews with aisles on either side and in the middle.</p>
				<h3 id="temperature-church">Temperature</h3>
				<p>On hot days the building can become quite warm especially with a large number of people inside. The church does not have air conditioning and is instead equipped with ceiling fans, and the windows may be cracked open. For cold days the church does have radiator heating.</p>
