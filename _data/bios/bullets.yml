  - name: Caroline DeBrota
    bio: "Caroline DeBrota (Samantha Spade, The Steve Starr Caper) (VOICEOVER): I stared down across the empty cast bio before me. Ever since I closed that performance of Night of the Living Deadback in 2023, I had known in my gut that I would one day be back on the PMRP stage...but had I realized it would be in my first truly \"Starr\"-ing role, after over 18 years of acting? The thing was, there really was more to the character of Samantha Spade than met the eye, er, Private Eye, if you will. Her no-nonsense detective work reminded me of my own calculated approach to my day job as an engineer, and all the lovey-dovey stuff with that secretary of hers certainly called to mind my relationship with the handsome actor Shawyoun Shaidani--a man so irresistible that we've found ourselves entangled in the past twelve shows together..... I snapped out of my recollective trance, realizing I had nothing to write in the cast bio, as I really had nothing to prove. And suddenly it struck me...that Dundee spelled backwards is Eednud!"
